My partner, Serenity Williams, and I, Tiana Martin, created this website for Highland Place Bed and Breakfast Inn. Highland Place Bed and Breakfast provides a small quality of a hotel, but with a more home like experience. It can be served as a venue for special events: weddings, showers, photo shoots, etc. We are both interested in furthering our experience someday in our careers.

This website was created to intrigue those out of town on business or tourist. Also, if you need a elegant venue for special occasions.

Website Feature:

<ul>
<li>On our client's original website, the room and events page were all unorganized together. We have rearranged it to were you have the rooms and events separated.</li>

<li>Our client's had an description on why to choose them. We decided to incorporate a slideshow of the rooms and breakfast as a visual of what to expect.</li>

<li> Highland Place Bed and Breakfast can be used in many ways. On the request instead of just room, you can request for an event as well. You will then receive an immediate notification of our recognition.</li>
