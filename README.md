My partner, Serenity Williams, and I, Tiana Martin, created this website for Highland Place Bed and Breakfast Inn. Highland Place Bed and Breakfast provides a small quality of a hotel, but with a more home like experience. It can be served as a venue for special events: weddings, showers, photo shoots, etc. We are both interested in furthering our experience someday in our careers.

This website was created to intrigue those out of town on business or tourist. Also, if you need a elegant venue for special occasions.
